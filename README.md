# Icelandic pronunciation dataset

This is the [Pronunciation Dictionary for Icelandic](http://malfong.is/?pg=framburdur&lang=en) by the [Hjal project](http://www.malfong.is/index.php?pg=hjal&lang=en) & Eiríkur Rögnvaldsson (released under [CC BY 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/)) with some changes.

**Includes:** 60,000 Icelandic words transcribed in the standardized Icelandic version of the International Phonetic Alphabet.

**Changes include:** Removal of regional variatiants, removal of "duplicates" when words are spelled the same but have different pronunciations ("halli" vs. "Halli"), fixes regarding [kʰ], [cʰ], [tʰ], and [pʰ] missing aspirations, several standardizations such as [œy] to [œi], [ɔu] to [ou].

**Known issues:** Several words that are supposed to include [kʰ], [cʰ], [tʰ], and [pʰ] in the middle are missing the aspirations – "umhverfi" [ʏmkʰvɛrvɪ] may for example be incorrectly written as  [ʏmkvɛrvɪ]. Regional variants and [heterophones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterophone) aren't included.
